HUMANS, MATTER AND TIME.

THE GOAL IS TO TURN ECONOMICS INTO A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM.
To start we are going to create THE MOST abstract view of reality possible. It is going to be so abstract that you are going to believe it was a waste of your time to read it. That will not be the case. 

# Just Matter
Let's start with just Matter.
    Matter is made up of Things. There are Base Things and Compound Things. BT is Base Thing(s) and CT is Compound Thing(s).  
    BT are the most basic Things in Matter. For instance if the Matter was based on the knowledge of reality in the 1930s the BT would be the electron, proton, and nuetron. As time went on Humanity discovered that the standard model made up electrons, protons, and nuetrons and so with this knowledge Matter would have the standard model as BT. 

    CT are bit more complex but not by much. A CT is built by BT with a specific "Pattern". So if the CT was a single hydrogen atom then the CT would built by these BT {proton, electon} with a specific Pattern. 
    
    Let's create a function that will give us a CT based on input BT and a pattern. This function will be CT(BT, P) and is 1-1.

    We also need to add a little caviat about indentification. How do we know if a CT is different from another CT if they share the same BT and Pattern? Hypothetically there could be two hydrogen atoms with the same BT, and Pattern. Now we need to add Space to the model. Let's assume each Thing now has a location and no two things can share a location. If two things share a location they are no longer to things; they are one (this would be a case of fusion). 

    So far we have just Matter defined. Matter consists of BT and CT. CT are made up of BT with a Pattern. All Things have a location in Space. So let's finally define Matter. Matter is now just information about the model's "reality". You can easily think of Matter as the "Matrix" from the Matrix movie. Matter (in total) consists of all BT and CT along with locations on both. There are also Patterns for each CT. 

    For a less formal but simplier breakdown we have this.
    Matter:
      - Things
        - BT
          - Electron, Proton, or Nuetron
          - Doesn't matter what this is defined as
        - CT
          - Made up of BT
          - Has a pattern
          - CT(BT, P) will input BT and a P to get CT. 1-1 function.
        - Location in Space
        
    Matter is the same as Things and will be used interchangably. Matter can not make any actions. This is not to say that Matter does not change without interactions, but that Matter does not change itself. Matter never changes anything.

    A tiny bit complex so far. Please make sure you understand this. Matter is everything and all information regarding matter; essentially just a matrix of information about reality.

# Add Time
Lets add Time into the mix. Time always ticks forward.
    Let's quickly describe a function to find Matter given Time. M(T) is Matter of Time. Given any positive Time: M(T) will return the matrix that is Matter. 

    For now-because we have only Matter defined-there is only one change to the model. Matter will now change over time just like how they do in real life. Erosion will create a rivine. Trees will grow over Time. Rivers will move rocks and Volcanoes will erupt. Much will happen as Time ticks forward. 
    
    "That's great and all but what does that mean?". 

    For one we now need to describe a function in which Matter changes over Time. So far we just have Matter and thus changes in Matter is determinate. The function we need to create is Δ(M(T)), change of Matter. Δ(M(T)) takes in a Matter matrix and outputs a new Matter matrix that is the succession of the old.
    
    At any given moment in Time we can now find what Matter looks like based on the last moment in Time. M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)). At each moment in time the matter matrix is static. Matter only changes when Time changes.

    Again this is deterministic. I am assuming only Humans have agency. Dogs, Cats, etc would thus all just be algorithms which would be deterministic and therefore taken into account in Δ(M(T)).

    This is a very simple way of viewing reality. Matter deterministically changes with Time. 

    Let's add to the less formal but simplier breakdown.
    Matter:
      - Things
        - BT
          - Electron, Proton, or Nuetron
          - Doesn't matter what this is defined as
        - CT
          - Made up of BT
          - Has a pattern
          - CT(BT, P) will input BT and a P to get CT. 1-1 function.
        - Location in Space
      - Equations
        - M(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
        - Δ(M(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.

    Again, not too complicated but please read until you understand what is happening.

    If we just "let the model lose" it would just be a Matter matrix deterministically changing over Time.

# Add Humans
Finally we need to add Humans.
    Humans have Internal Utility and a Spirit. No Matter has Utility or a Spirit, only Humans have them. Humans create Demand which originates from the Spirit. 

    We are going to define Humans the same way we defined Matter except this time there is no split in Humans and there is nothing resembling a Pattern. H(T) is the state of Humans at a moment in Time. We are also going to need a change function. Δ(H(T)) is change of Humans. We can see Humans move from one point in time to another with H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

    In the real world Humans act indeterministically and thus are hard to model. Assume Δ(H(T)) incorporates both the deterministic and the free will based changes to the Human matrix.

    Humans create Demand (that originate from the Human's Spirit) with the intent the Demand Connects with Supply (Matter) on the Supply & Demand Field. These Demands can be complex or simple. They may be simply breathing or launching a rocketship. We will describe the Supply & Demand Field soon.

    When Demand Connects with Supply on the Supply & Demand Field every relevant Human's Internal Utility will change. The Human's Internal Utility may change a lot or it may change a little.

    Not every Human's Internal Utility will change with every Supply & Demand Connection. In the real world this could theoretically happen, but it would be would be extremely rare. I could really only see this happening if there was a small amount of people who are all entangled in one Supply.

    If we let this model loose currently it would just be Humans and Matter updating each other over Time. There wouldn't be much insight and it would be very boring.

    Let's add Humans to the breakdown.
    Matter:
      - Things
        - BT
          - Electron, Proton, or Nuetron
          - Doesn't matter what this is defined as
        - CT
          - Made up of BT
          - Has a pattern
          - CT(BT, P) will input BT and a P to get CT. 1-1 function.
        - Location in Space
      - Equations
        - M(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
        - Δ(M(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.
        - M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)).

    Humans:
      - Have
        - Spirit
          - The Spirit creates Demand
        - Internal Utility
      - Equations
        - H(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
        - Δ(H(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.
        - H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

    Because we have briefly touched upon both Supply and Demand I will start using "S&D" instead of saying "Supply & Demand"

# What is the S&D Field?
  You've probably noticed we have two sets of terms. "Matter and Humans" and "S&D". These are essentially interchangable but let's formally describe the interaction just to remove any confusion. To do this we are going to split the sets of terms and say they are related to each other based on the S&D Field. "S&DF" is "Supply & Demand Field" or "S&D Field".

  Matter and Humans are the most basic units in this Model. Matter is essentially just the Matrix from the Movie _The Matrix_ and Humans are just Humans.

  Matter does not need Humans and Humans do not need Matter. 
    _In the real world Humans obviously need Matter, but I want the model as abstract as possible so just ignore that._

  Humans create Demand that originates from the Spirit.
  Matter is Supply.

  Because we know the following
    - Humans and Matter both change over Time
    - Demand originates from a Human's Spirit
    - Supply is Matter
  we now also know that Demand and Supply change over Time.

  So how do Humans and Matter interact?
    Through Supply and Demand.

  Not helpful. How do Supply and Demand interact?
    They interact on the S&DF

  What is the S&DF?

  Great question. A Human's Demand will always want to Connect with Supply from Matter. In a very simple case of a Human wanting to breathe the interaction is easy to see. The Human who wants to breathe is creating Demand for oxygen. This oxygen is part of Matter which means the wanted oxygen is Supply. So, in sum, the Human is creating Demand for Supply and the Supply-who the Demand wants to Connect with-is oxygen. If the Human does successfully breathe this means that the Demand Connected with Supply. If the Human fails to breathe that means the Demand failed to Connect with Supply. In this case the Human would be in a bit of a panic. Not all potential S&D Connections will be this serious. Maybe a Human wants to eat a sandwhich in which case failure wouldn't really matter.

  The created Demand and inherient Supply do not actually exist. Don't get me wrong the Humans and Matter do exist; it's just D&S does not. You can never point to a Demand or point to a Supply. You could point to a Thing but not a Supply. And you could point to a Human but not a demand. The S&D both exist on a Field. A sort of battleground. On this battleground it is decided which D&S will Connect and which won't.

  It's important to understand S&D do not exist in Space. Again, you can not point to Supply or Demand. Because of this it's hard to visualize the processes involved. Because of this difficulty we are going to view S&D on a "Field". This Field will be visualized like a simple euclidean plane. There will be Supply and there will be Demand on the Field. The location of the Supply or the Demand on the Field is irrelevant. This is simply to visualize what is happening. A Demand could Connect with a Supply even if they are very far apart. 

  The Supply will look a shape because it is the easiest way to visualize Matter (Things) as being different from each other but similiar in the fact that Supply is not Demand.

  Demand will be visualized as an arrow with a number at the tip and a shape in the middle. The number at the tip will be the number of who's Spirit the Demand originated from. And the shape will be the Supply the Demand wants to connect with. If the arrow has a 3 at the tip then you will know the Demand originated from Spirit #3. If the arrow has a circle in the middle then you will know the Demand wants to Connect with a circle (whatever the circle may be).
  
  The origin of the arrow on the plane is irrelevant, but the origin of the arrow in respect to who's Spirit it came from is relevant. This is why the number is at the tip. Later the origin will have greater importance on it.

  On top of this it's important to understand that in the real world there is essentially an infinite number of Things thus there would need to be an infinite number of shapes. Obviously this is not possible so there will always be not enough shapes shown to be 1-1 with the real world. 

  Let's do a quick breakdown again:
  S&DF:
    - Supply
      - Visualized as shapes
    - Demand
      - Visualized as arrows
      - Number at the tip is to associate the Demand with a Spirit
      - Shape in the middle is to visualize what Supply the Demand wants. 

  In sum, the S&DF is not a physical field. You can not point any of the three: Supply, Demand, or the Field itself. The S&DF is simply a way of visualizing how Supply and Demand interact or connect. From this visualization we can see how Humans and Matter affect each other over time.

# A Quick Overview Of The Model
  There are two main parts to the model so far. There is Matter and Humans, and there is the S&DF. The physical and the non physical.
    
  Matter is M(T) and changes over one moment in Time with Δ(M(T)). The present and the one moment forward future is related with M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)).
  Humans is H(T) and changes over one moment in Time with Δ(H(T)). The present and the one moment forward future is related with H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

  Physical
    Matter:
      - Things
        - BT
          - Electron, Proton, or Nuetron
          - Doesn't matter what this is defined as
        - CT
          - Made up of BT
          - Has a pattern
          - CT(BT, P) will input BT and a P to get CT. 1-1 function.
        - Location in Space
      - Equations
        - M(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
        - Δ(M(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.
        - M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)).
    Humans:
      - Have
        - Spirit
          - The Spirit creates Demand
        - Internal Utility
      - Equations
        - H(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
        - Δ(H(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.
        - H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

  Non Physical
    S&DF:
    - Supply
      - Visualized as shapes
    - Demand
      - Visualized as arrows
      - Number at the tip is to associate the Demand with a Spirit
      - Shape in the middle is to visualize what Supply the Demand wants.

  As Time ticks forward one moment at a time we will see H(T) and M(T) change. Any change that occurs for Humans in a moment will originate from a single or multiple Demand and Supply Connecting in the moment. We can not say the same about Matter. Matter changes may originate from a S&D Connection or from Matter deterministically changing over Time.

# Let's See How The Model Works With One Person
  For now let's start off with just one Human in Humans. 

  This Human will want to change the enviornment, they will want to eat, drink, etc. They may want to make a house or feed chickens. Maybe help a calf be born. No matter what the Human wants to do they will always create Demand. This Demand will show up in the S&DF. If any of the Demands Connect with Supply Matter will change and the single Human's Internal Utility will change. Because there is only one Human the Human's Utility will essentially only go up. Just about Human _in real life_ will act in a Utility Maximizing behavior. Obviously there are occurances where this doesn't happen. On top of this, the Human will never have Demand Rejected. They are the only Demand. No one else is there to Demand Supply that the one Human wants to Connect with. 

  The Human creates and destroys Demand in the moment. And as moments progress the Human will have Demand Connect with Supply which will occur on the S&DF.

  In any given moment the Human can only have certain Demands connect with Supply. In other words the Human can not do two things at the same time. If the Human wants to jetski they can not create demand for reading a book. In the moment: either the Human jetskis or reads. Which ever action they do determines which Demand Connects with Supply. If the Human decides to read then the Demand for reading will Connect with Supply but the Demand to jetski will not. Because of this we have Opportunity Cost.

  _In the real world_ everyone faces opportunity cost. You can not get drunk and stay sober at any given moment in time. You can not eat just eggs and eat just bacon in the morning. That isn't to say you can't eat both in the morning. If you want to eat eggs and bacon in the morning then be my guest. But if you eat both you did not eat just bacon or just eggs. The common saying is "You can't eat your cake and have it too". All Humans experience opportunity cost because of this. When more Humans are brought into the model to further our understanding then we will see more complexity to Opportunity Cost.

  Will just one individual the model is rather boring. There is no complex interactions outside of Opportunity Cost existing. The world is this one Human's Oyster!

# Let's add a second Human










### Value Functions in a pre-sin world
Let's ask a _very simple_ question given a Thing. What is the Value of this Thing?
    Let's view the Thing as having Matter and assume there is Humans from Humans or Humans from CoH.
    The question is now "Well what the Value of this Matter given there could possibly be Humans from the origins described?"
    
    Right off the bat we run into a problem. What does Value even mean? Does Value equate to how many Humanss couldn't be connected with Matter? I.E. only Things in a shortage have Value? Maybe Value means how many Humanss for the Matter could make connections? Does the oxygen on Earth have more Value than all the Doornobs simply because all the oxygen on Earth satisfies more Humans than all the doornobs do? Essentially there are an infinite number of ways Value could be described which means this is getting out of hand fast. 
    
    For now let's take a step back. Let's just assume that Value is some abstract equation about Matter and Humans of a Thing. Let's call this function V(T). Value of a Thing. And we can say V(T) is what ever we want. If we want to define Value of a Thing as how much Humans couldn't be connected with Matter (this would be shortages) than we can. We could also define Value as how many Humanss could make connections. Or even how many Humanss did make a connection. Again, lots of ways to define Value.

    Easy enough definition for Value. That means we are done right? No. What moment in Time are we talking about? On the Earth before Humans existed there was no Humans. Again, only Humans Humans. If a fox eats a rabbit that is Things changing over time. That means most Value Functions are going to fail. Value is only in relation to Humans. Matter (Things) itself have no Value.

    For now because we are pre-sin we can easily define Value as a Value Function. I'm going to now define Value as the maximum Utility that can be gained from Humans (Humans). If Humanity have two or more possible interactions with a specific Thing than we can say that the Value of this Thing would be the Value of Utility Maximizing interaction. 

    For example.
    1. Interaction to gain 15 Utility for Human A.
    2. Interaction to gain 20 Utility for Human B.

    Because Human B's interaction gained more Utility, 20 Utility is now the Value of the Thing in that given Time.

    I think this definition would be compatible with the knowledge of Value through all of Time only because this is pre-sin. I think post-sin there is breakdown bc of a want to hoard.

    All this will thrown out the window post-sin. Sing and knowledge of Value over all Time are not compatable.

### HELLO

When you ask the question "What is the Value of a Thing?" We have to know the all information from all of time. And if in the moment any information is used to gain personal leverage (money) than the whole system collapses. Only when everyThing was in the CC did Value have a way to acceptably defined. If the Value of a Thing is known in Time t then the Thing could be hoarded (PP) changing the Value of a Thing. Did hoarding add Value for the Thing?




### SCHIZO

You NEED to wake up early. The devil is gonna wake you up and say "Quick live forever, God will let you die". Those who choose to live forever will surely die. God doesn't care that you are going to die. He was going to give you eternal life anyways. He cares about whether you abandon sin or not. The compounding force with sin leads to death at infinity. Either you go live forever without sin in Heaven or you live forever with sin in Hell.
