HUMANS, MATTER AND TIME.

THE GOAL IS TO TURN ECONOMICS INTO A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM.
To start we are going to create THE MOST abstract view of realitty possible. It is going to be so abstract that you are going to believe it was a waste of your time to read it. That will not be the case. 

# Just Matter
Let's start with just Matter.
    Matter is Things. There are Base Things and Compound Things. BT is Base Thing(s) and CT is Compound Thing(s).  
    BT are the most basic Things in the Model. For instance if the Model was based on the knowledge of reality in the 1930s the BT would be the electron, proton, and nuetron. As time went on Humanity discovered that the standard model made up electrons, protons, and nuetrons and so with this knowledge the model would have the standard model as BT. 

    CT are bit more complex but not by much. A CT is built by BT with a specific "Pattern". So if the CT was a single hydrogen atom then the CT would built by these BT {proton, electon} with a specific Pattern. Assume that there is an algorithm or equation that always outputs the same CT given the same BT and a Pattern. The algorithm is 1-1.

    We also need to add a little caviat about indentification. How do we know if a CT is different from another CT if they share the same BT and Pattern? Hypothetically there could be two hydrogen atoms with the same BT, and Pattern. At this moment we now need to add Space to the model. Let's assume each Thing now has a location and no two things can share a location. If two things share a location they are no longer to things; they are one (This is fusion). 

    So far we have just Matter defined. Matter consists of BT and CT. CT are made up of BT with a Pattern. All Things have a location in Space. So let's finally define Matter. Matter is now just information about the model's "reality". Matter (in total) consists of all BT and CT along with locations on both. There are also Patterns for each CT. 

    Matter is the same as Things and will be used interchangably. Matter can not make any actions. This is not to say that Matter does not change without interactions, but that Matter does not change itself. Matter never changes anything.

    A tiny bit complex so far. Please make sure you understand this. Matter is everything and all information regarding matter; essentially just a matrix of information about reality.

# Add Time
Lets add Time into the mix. Time always ticks forward.
    Let's quickly describe a function to find Matter given Time. M(T) is Matter of Time. Given any positive Time: M(T) will return the matrix that is Matter. 

    For now-because we have only Matter defined-there is only one change to the model. Matter will now change over time just like how they do in real life. Erosion will create a rivine. Trees will grow over Time. Rivers will move rocks and Volcanoes will erupt. Much will happen as Time ticks forward. 
    
    "That's great and all but what does that mean?". 

    For one we now need to describe a function in which Matter changes over Time. There will not be any Humans and thus change in Matter is determinate. The function we need to create is Δ(M), change of Matter. Δ(M) takes in a Matter matrix and outputs a new Matter matrix that is the succession of the old.
    
    At any given moment in Time we can now find what Matter looks like based on the last moment in Time. M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)).

    Again this is deterministic. I am assuming only Humans have agency. Dogs, Cats, etc would thus all just be algorithms which would be deterministic and therefore taken into account in Δ(M).

    This is a very simple way of viewing reality. Matter deterministically changes with Time. 

    Again, not too complicated but please read until you understand what is happening.

# Add Humans
Finally we need to add Humans.
    Humans gain Utility from actions. Humans act by Demanding an interaction with Supply from Matter. Every moment when Demand and Supply meet a the related Human's Utility changes.  Every moment multiple (or none or all) Humans will interact with Matter. The Humans that affected Matter will have their Utility changed. 
    
    On top of the Human element there is Matter to consider too. Matter will change with every interaction too. If a Human wants to simply breathe this will still affect Matter. 

    We are going to define Humans the same way we defined Matter except this time there is no split in Humans and there is nothing resembling a Pattern. H(T) is the state of Humans of a moment in Time. We are also going to need a change function. Δ(H) is change of Humans. We can see Humans move from one point in time to another with H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

    Humans interact with Matter with intention of maximizing everyone's Utility. Humans prefer the Utility maximizing decision be made no matter whos Demand is satisfied. In this way Humans will reject each other and their own Demands in favor of allowing the Utility Maximizing Demand connect with the chosen Supply.

    Demand (Humans) will Filter Demand for which Demand will connect with Supply. In this way there is no need for Private Property. This is essentially a Utopia (theoritical communism); obviously not how the real work works. 
    
    The question needs to be asked why does communism not work? We were given a manual on how to run a perfect economy. Why does it not work in the real world? Why did American markets been the USSR? Why did China stop being communist and start be (at times) more capitalist than America is? Communism does not work because in the real world Demand does not filter Demand in the real world. Who ever owns supply decides what Demand connects with the given Supply. 

    Currently the model is pre-sin, and while pre-sin there is no need for Private Property. Humans will act in a Utopian fashion (again, this is theoretical communism). When we are post-sin we will see why private property is needed and thus we will see why theoritical communism does not work.

    For now essentially all you need to know is that Humans will act without sin. The theoretical communist model will work for now.

    



    Talk about Subjectivity Utility. Value ony matters post-sin. 

    Whether or not in a given in moment in time a Demand connects with a Supply is irrelevant. Humans will always percieve the difference in reality leading to different subjective values.














There is Humans, Matter, and Time. Demmand and Matter Connect over Time yet non are independant of each other. All three are correlated to each other are require each other.

Humans and Matter are related because Humans requires Matter for Humans to be fulfilled. This gives Humans Utility and updates Things ("The Matrix").
Deamnd, Matter, and Time are related because Humans connects with Matter over Time. On top of this Value of a Thing (Matter) requires knowledge of all Humans for that Thing over all of Time. You would need to know every instance in time where that Thing was Humanss and even not Humansed. On top of this you would need to know every specific about the Humans in the instance of time. Was there a lot of Humans? Little? Was it from the Rich? Poor? Was it Consumption Humans? Investment Humans? Humans from Debt? All of these matter.


### Value Functions in a pre-sin world
Let's ask a _very simple_ question given a Thing. What is the Value of this Thing?
    Let's view the Thing as having Matter and assume there is Humans from Humans or Humans from CoH.
    The question is now "Well what the Value of this Matter given there could possibly be Humans from the origins described?"
    
    Right off the bat we run into a problem. What does Value even mean? Does Value equate to how many Humanss couldn't be connected with Matter? I.E. only Things in a shortage have Value? Maybe Value means how many Humanss for the Matter could make connections? Does the oxygen on Earth have more Value than all the Doornobs simply because all the oxygen on Earth satisfies more Humans than all the doornobs do? Essentially there are an infinite number of ways Value could be described which means this is getting out of hand fast. 
    
    For now let's take a step back. Let's just assume that Value is some abstract equation about Matter and Humans of a Thing. Let's call this function V(T). Value of a Thing. And we can say V(T) is what ever we want. If we want to define Value of a Thing as how much Humans couldn't be connected with Matter (this would be shortages) than we can. We could also define Value as how many Humanss could make connections. Or even how many Humanss did make a connection. Again, lots of ways to define Value.

    Easy enough definition for Value. That means we are done right? No. What moment in Time are we talking about? On the Earth before Humans existed there was no Humans. Again, only Humans Humans. If a fox eats a rabbit that is Things changing over time. That means most Value Functions are going to fail. Value is only in relation to Humans. Matter (Things) itself have no Value.

    For now because we are pre-sin we can easily define Value as a Value Function. I'm going to now define Value as the maximum Utility that can be gained from Humans (Humans). If Humanity have two or more possible interactions with a specific Thing than we can say that the Value of this Thing would be the Value of Utility Maximizing interaction. 

    For example.
    1. Interaction to gain 15 Utility for Human A.
    2. Interaction to gain 20 Utility for Human B.

    Because Human B's interaction gained more Utility, 20 Utility is now the Value of the Thing in that given Time.

    I think this definition would be compatible with the knowledge of Value through all of Time only because this is pre-sin. I think post-sin there is breakdown bc of a want to hoard.

    All this will thrown out the window post-sin. Sing and knowledge of Value over all Time are not compatable.

### HELLO

When you ask the question "What is the Value of a Thing?" We have to know the all information from all of time. And if in the moment any information is used to gain personal leverage (money) than the whole system collapses. Only when everyThing was in the CC did Value have a way to acceptably defined. If the Value of a Thing is known in Time t then the Thing could be hoarded (PP) changing the Value of a Thing. Did hoarding add Value for the Thing?




### SCHIZO

You NEED to wake up early. The devil is gonna wake you up and say "Quick live forever, God will let you die". Those who choose to live forever will surely die. God doesn't care that you are going to die. He was going to give you eternal life anyways. He cares about whether you abandon sin or not. The compounding force with sin leads to death at infinity. Either you go live forever without sin in Heaven or you live forever with sin in Hell.
