HUMANS, MATTER AND TIME.

THE GOAL IS TO TURN ECONOMICS INTO A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM.
To start we are going to create THE MOST abstract view of reality possible. It is going to be so abstract that you are going to believe it was a waste of your time to read it. That will not be the case. 

# Basics Of The Model

## Just Matter
  Let's start with just Matter.

  Matter is made up of Things. There are Base Things and Compound Things. BT is Base Thing(s) and CT is Compound Thing(s).  
  BT are the most basic Things in Matter. For instance if the Matter was based on the knowledge of reality in the 1930s the BT would be the electron, proton, and nuetron. As time went on Humanity discovered that the standard model made up electrons, protons, and nuetrons and so with this knowledge Matter would have the standard model as BT. 

  CT are bit more complex but not by much. A CT is built by BT with a specific "Pattern". So if the CT was a single hydrogen atom then the CT would built by these BT {proton, electon} with a specific Pattern. 
  
  Let's create a function that will give us a CT based on input BT and a pattern. This function will be CT(BT, P) and is 1-1.

  We also need to add a little caviat about indentification. How do we know if a CT is different from another CT if they share the same BT and Pattern? Hypothetically there could be two hydrogen atoms with the same BT, and Pattern. Now we need to add Space to the model. Let's assume each Thing now has a location and no two things can share a location. If two things share a location they are no longer to things; they are one (this would be a case of fusion). 

  So far we have just Matter defined. Matter consists of BT and CT. CT are made up of BT with a Pattern. All Things have a location in Space. So let's finally define Matter. Matter is now just information about the model's "reality". You can easily think of Matter as the "Matrix" from the Matrix movie. Matter (in total) consists of all BT and CT along with locations on both. There are also Patterns for each CT. 

  For a less formal but simplier breakdown we have this.
  Matter:
    - Things
      - BT
        - Electron, Proton, or Nuetron
        - Doesn't matter what this is defined as
      - CT
        - Made up of BT
        - Has a pattern
        - CT(BT, P) will input BT and a P to get CT. 1-1 function.
      - Location in Space
      
  Matter is the same as Things and will be used interchangably. Matter can not make any actions. This is not to say that Matter does not change without interactions, but that Matter does not change itself. Matter never changes anything.

  A tiny bit complex so far. Please make sure you understand this. Matter is everything and all information regarding matter; essentially just a matrix of information about reality.

## Add Time
  Lets add Time into the mix. Time always ticks forward.
  
  Let's quickly describe a function to find Matter given Time. M(T) is Matter of Time. Given any positive Time: M(T) will return the matrix that is Matter. 

  For now-because we have only Matter defined-there is only one change to the model. Matter will now change over time just like how they do in real life. Erosion will create a rivine. Trees will grow over Time. Rivers will move rocks and Volcanoes will erupt. Much will happen as Time ticks forward. 
  
  "That's great and all but what does that mean?". 

  For one we now need to describe a function in which Matter changes over Time. So far we just have Matter and thus changes in Matter is determinate. The function we need to create is Δ(M(T)), change of Matter. Δ(M(T)) takes in a Matter matrix and outputs a new Matter matrix that is the succession of the old.
  
  At any given moment in Time we can now find what Matter looks like based on the last moment in Time. M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)). At each moment in time the matter matrix is static. Matter only changes when Time changes.

  Again this is deterministic. I am assuming only Humans have agency. Dogs, Cats, etc would thus all just be algorithms which would be deterministic and therefore taken into account in Δ(M(T)).

  This is a very simple way of viewing reality. Matter deterministically changes with Time. 

  Let's add to the less formal but simplier breakdown.
  Matter:
    - Things
      - BT
        - Electron, Proton, or Nuetron
        - Doesn't matter what this is defined as
      - CT
        - Made up of BT
        - Has a pattern
        - CT(BT, P) will input BT and a P to get CT. 1-1 function.
      - Location in Space
    - Equations
      - M(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
      - Δ(M(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.

  Again, not too complicated but please read until you understand what is happening.

  If we just "let the model lose" it would just be a Matter matrix deterministically changing over Time.

## Add Humans
  Finally we need to add Humans.

  Humans have Internal Utility and a Spirit. No Matter has Utility or a Spirit, only Humans have them. Humans create Demand which originates from the Spirit. 

  We are going to define Humans the same way we defined Matter except this time there is no split in Humans and there is nothing resembling a Pattern. H(T) is the state of Humans at a moment in Time. We are also going to need a change function. Δ(H(T)) is change of Humans. We can see Humans move from one point in time to another with H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

  In the real world Humans act indeterministically and thus are hard to model. Assume Δ(H(T)) incorporates both the deterministic and the free will based changes to the Human matrix.

  Humans create Demand (that originate from the Human's Spirit) with the intent the Demand Connects with Supply (Matter) on the Supply & Demand Field. These Demands can be complex or simple. They may be simply breathing or launching a rocketship. We will describe the Supply & Demand Field soon.

  When Demand Connects with Supply on the Supply & Demand Field every relevant Human's Internal Utility will change. The Human's Internal Utility may change a lot or it may change a little. Internal Utility is essentially just happiness of the Human. Each moment, when S&D Connect, there is a Utility change for all Human's Internal Utility. The intermoment changes to Internal Utility matter as well as the overall long running Internal Utility for a Human just like how your day to day happiness matter just as much as your yearly and lifetime happiness.

  Not every Human's Internal Utility will change with every Supply & Demand Connection. In the real world this could theoretically happen, but it would be would be extremely rare. I could really only see this happening if there was a small amount of people who are all entangled in one Supply.

  If we let this model loose currently it would just be Humans and Matter updating each other over Time. There wouldn't be much insight and it would be very boring.

  Let's add Humans to the breakdown.
  Matter:
    - Things
      - BT
        - Electron, Proton, or Nuetron
        - Doesn't matter what this is defined as
      - CT
        - Made up of BT
        - Has a pattern
        - CT(BT, P) will input BT and a P to get CT. 1-1 function.
      - Location in Space
    - Equations
      - M(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
      - Δ(M(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.
      - M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)).

  Humans:
    - Have
      - Spirit
        - The Spirit creates Demand
      - Internal Utility
    - Equations
      - H(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
      - Δ(H(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.
      - H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

  Because we have briefly touched upon both Supply and Demand I will start using "S&D" instead of saying "Supply & Demand"

## What is the S&D Field?
  You've probably noticed we have two sets of terms. "Matter and Humans" and "S&D". These are essentially interchangable but let's formally describe the interaction just to remove any confusion. To do this we are going to split the sets of terms and say they are related to each other based on the S&D Field. "S&DF" is "Supply & Demand Field" or "S&D Field".

  Matter and Humans are the most basic units in this Model. Matter is essentially just the Matrix from the Movie _The Matrix_ and Humans are just Humans.

  Matter does not need Humans and Humans do not need Matter. 
    _In the real world Humans obviously need Matter, but I want the model as abstract as possible so just ignore that._

  Humans create Demand that originates from the Spirit.
  Matter is Supply.

  Because we know the following
    - Humans and Matter both change over Time
    - Demand originates from a Human's Spirit
    - Supply is Matter
  we now also know that Demand and Supply change over Time.

  So how do Humans and Matter interact?
    Through Supply and Demand.

  Not helpful. How do Supply and Demand interact?
    They interact on the S&DF

  What is the S&DF?

  Great question. A Human's Demand will always want to Connect with Supply from Matter. In a very simple case of a Human wanting to breathe the interaction is easy to see. The Human who wants to breathe is creating Demand for oxygen. This oxygen is part of Matter which means the wanted oxygen is Supply. So, in sum, the Human is creating Demand for Supply and the Supply-who the Demand wants to Connect with-is oxygen. If the Human does successfully breathe this means that the Demand Connected with Supply. If the Human fails to breathe that means the Demand failed to Connect with Supply. In this case the Human would be in a bit of a panic. Not all potential S&D Connections will be this serious. Maybe a Human wants to eat a sandwhich in which case failure wouldn't really matter.

  The created Demand and inherient Supply do not actually exist. Don't get me wrong the Humans and Matter do exist; it's just S&D does not. You can never point to a Demand or point to a Supply. You could point to a Thing but not a Supply. And you could point to a Human but not a demand. The S&D both exist on a Field. A sort of battleground. On this battleground it is decided which S&D will Connect and which won't.

  It's important to understand S&D do not exist in Space. Again, you can not point to Supply or Demand. Because of this it's hard to visualize the processes involved. Because of this difficulty we are going to view S&D on a "Field". This Field will be visualized like a simple euclidean plane. There will be Supply and there will be Demand on the Field. The location of the Supply or the Demand on the Field is irrelevant. This is simply to visualize what is happening. A Demand could Connect with a Supply even if they are very far apart. 

  The Supply will look a shape because it is the easiest way to visualize Matter (Things) as being different from each other but similiar in the fact that Supply is not Demand.

  Demand will be visualized as an arrow with a number at the tip and a shape in the middle. The number at the tip will be the number of who's Spirit the Demand originated from. And the shape will be the Supply the Demand wants to connect with. If the arrow has a 3 at the tip then you will know the Demand originated from Spirit #3. If the arrow has a circle in the middle then you will know the Demand wants to Connect with a circle (whatever the circle may be).
  
  The origin of the arrow on the plane is irrelevant, but the origin of the arrow in respect to who's Spirit it came from is relevant. This is why the number is at the tip. Later the origin will have greater importance on it.

  On top of this it's important to understand that in the real world there is essentially an infinite number of Things thus there would need to be an infinite number of shapes. Obviously this is not possible so there will always be not enough shapes shown to be 1-1 with the real world. 

  Let's do a quick breakdown again:
  S&DF:
    - Supply
      - Visualized as shapes
    - Demand
      - Visualized as arrows
      - Number at the tip is to associate the Demand with a Spirit
      - Shape in the middle is to visualize what Supply the Demand wants. 

  In sum, the S&DF is not a physical field. You can not point any of the three: Supply, Demand, or the Field itself. The S&DF is simply a way of visualizing how Supply and Demand interact or connect. From this visualization we can see how Humans and Matter affect each other over time.

## A Quick Overview Of The Model
  There are two main parts to the model so far. There is Matter and Humans, and there is the S&DF. The physical and the non physical.
    
  Matter is M(T) and changes over one moment in Time with Δ(M(T)). The present and the one moment forward future is related with M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)).
  Humans is H(T) and changes over one moment in Time with Δ(H(T)). The present and the one moment forward future is related with H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

  Physical
    Matter:
      - Things
        - BT
          - Electron, Proton, or Nuetron
          - Doesn't matter what this is defined as
        - CT
          - Made up of BT
          - Has a pattern
          - CT(BT, P) will input BT and a P to get CT. 1-1 function.
        - Location in Space
      - Equations
        - M(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
        - Δ(M(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.
        - M(T) = Δ(M(T-1)).
    Humans:
      - Have
        - Spirit
          - The Spirit creates Demand
        - Internal Utility
      - Equations
        - H(T) will give the state of Matter at Time T.
        - Δ(H(T)) will return the next succession of the Matter matrix.
        - H(T) = Δ(H(T-1)).

  Non Physical
    S&DF:
    - Supply
      - Visualized as shapes
    - Demand
      - Visualized as arrows
      - Number at the tip is to associate the Demand with a Spirit
      - Shape in the middle is to visualize what Supply the Demand wants.

  As we've discussed earlier, every S&D Connection changes both Matter and Humans. With regards to Matter it changes Things in some way which changes Supply on the S&DF. With regards to Humans it changes Internal Utility and all relevant Humans will update what Demands they have. It's important to notice that with every S&D Connection both Demand and Supply will change on the S&DF.

  As Time ticks forward one moment at a time we will see H(T) and M(T) change. Any change that occurs for Humans in a moment will originate from a single or multiple Demand and Supply Connecting in the moment. We can not say the same about Matter. Matter changes may originate from a S&D Connection or from Matter deterministically changing over Time.

# Start Using the Model

## Let's See How The Model Works With One Person
  For now let's start off with just one Human in Humans. 

  This Human will want to change the enviornment, they will want to eat, drink, etc. They may want to make a house or feed chickens. Maybe help a calf be born. No matter what the Human wants to do they will always create Demand. This Demand will show up in the S&DF. If any of the Demands Connect with Supply Matter will change and the single Human's Internal Utility will change. Because there is only one Human the Human's Utility will essentially only go up. Just about Human _in real life_ will act in a Utility Maximizing behavior. Obviously there are occurances where this doesn't happen. On top of this, the Human will never have Demand Rejected. They are the only Demand. No one else is there to Demand Supply that the one Human wants to Connect with. 

  The Human creates and destroys Demand in the moment. And as moments progress the Human will have Demand Connect with Supply which will occur on the S&DF.

  In any given moment the Human can only have certain Demands connect with Supply. In other words the Human can not do two things at the same time. If the Human wants to jetski they can not create demand for reading a book. In the moment: either the Human jetskis or reads. Which ever action they do determines which Demand Connects with Supply. If the Human decides to read then the Demand for reading will Connect with Supply but the Demand to jetski will not. Because of this we have Opportunity Cost.

  _In the real world_ everyone faces Opportunity Cost. You can not get drunk and stay sober at any given moment in time. You can not eat just eggs and eat just bacon in the morning. That isn't to say you can't eat both in the morning. If you want to eat eggs and bacon in the morning then be my guest. But if you eat both you did not eat just bacon or just eggs. The common saying is "You can't eat your cake and have it too". All Humans experience Opportunity Cost because of this. When more Humans are brought into the model to further our understanding then we will see more complexity to Opportunity Cost.

  There is also another aspect to talk about. How does the Human know what it wants to do? All Humans have a Subjective perspective on both Matter and Humans. They will have a subjective perspective on all Demand and all Supply. In this way Humans do not know the true outcome of every possible S&D Connection, but they do have a Subjective perspective on all of them. The perspective may be close to the truth or it may be far.

  So what do I mean? 

  When this Human creates a Demand for some Supply there is an objective change to the Human's Internal Utility and Matter if the Demand Connects with the Supply. However, the Human does not know what that true change is for either Humans or Matter. What the Human think is going to happen is the Human's Subjective Perspective. Human's have a Subjective Perspective on all Supply and all Demand. Even if the Demand did not come from them. Ownership of Supply is irrelevant here as there is only one person. Who would dispute the one Human's claim to the world?

  In this way Humans will choose to Demand for Subjective Utility Maximizing decisions in hopes it maximizes actual Internal Utility. 

  I'm going to add a couple of terms here and in the example we will see what I mean for each.
  OUS is Objective Utility for a Subject
  SUS is Subjective Utility for a Subject

  ### A quick example to understand decision making :
    In a moment there are two possible S&D Connections with different OUS and SUS. The Human can only facilitate one of the possible Connections.
    
    Possible Connection A has OUS = 20 & SUS = 30
    Possible Connection B has OUS = 50 & SUS = 5

    Because there is one Human there only one Subject. This means that the Subject (the final 'S') in OUS and SUS has to be for this one Human. There is an Objective/Subjective split (the first letter; 'O' and 'S') because there is a true change and an expected change. The true change is Objective while the expected change is Subjective. 

    For all Possible Connections between any S&D there is a single OUS for every Human. This is because there is an Objectively true change all Human's will have for their Internal Utility when a S&D Connection happens. The 'S' in "OUS" is the Subject in context. For now, because we only have one Human, the Subject will always be this one Human. When we have two people there will be two OUSs per possible S&D Connection. The two OUSs will have different Subjects (the two different Humans).
    
    In regards to SUS it is not that simple. Every Human has a different perspective and thus every Human has a different percieved outcome. This is where SUS, which is different than OUS, comes into play. The first 'S' in "SUS" refers to the Human doing to Subjecting. The 'U' is Utility. And the last 'S' is about the Human who is affected. It is important to understand that every Human will have a SUS for every other Human as the subject in regard to every possible S&D Connection. There were three "every"s in that sentence so it's very easy to see that there gets to be a lot of information to handle very quickly. 
    
    For now because we only have one Human there is only one OUS and only one SUS per possible S&D Connection. When we have two Humans there will be one OUS per Human for each possible S&D Connection. There will also be 4 SUS per possible S&D Connection. Each Human will do the Subjecting and be the Subject.

    Quick Table:
    Number of Humans  | Number of OUS / possible Connection | Number of SUS / possible Connection  
    1                 | 1                                   | 1
    2                 | 2                                   | 4
    3                 | 3                                   | 9
    n                 | n                                   | n*n

    Here the Human will choose to facilitate Connection A because the SUS is higher. But objectively this was an awful decision; Connecion B offer over twice the OUS!

  Based on the example it is very easy to see that Humans are dumb! They will choose to facilitate S&D Connections that do not maximize OUS. They will choose to facilitate S&D Connections that maximize SUS in an attempt to maximize OUS. Not every time will the Human be wrong. More often than not Humans will make the OUS maximizing decions. In this case the single Human will have made a "bad" decision, but it won't matter: OUS was positive and ignorance is bliss. As far as the Human is concerned he made the OUS maximizing decision. 
  
  It is also very easy to see Opportunity Cost here. If the Human chooses to facilitate Connection A then they also choose not to facilitate Connection B. And the opposite is also true. If the Human chooses to facilitate B then they did not facilitate A. The Opportunity Cost of A is B and the Opportunity Cost of B is A. 

  With just one individual the model is rather boring. There is no complex interactions outside of Opportunity Cost and Subjectivity. The world is this one Human's Oyster! If the Human could live forever they would end up with infinite Internal Utility.

## Value With One Person
  Value is a rather hard concept to understand, explain, or even just design. To be perfectly frank I'd rather not touch on Value, just because it is so complex, but I do not have that luxery and for this model to mean anything we need to understand Value. So the question must be asked "What is Value?". A rather TOUGH question.

  In regards to the real world people view value as a means to an end. They buy stocks, real estate, gold, silver, watches, collectable, even old games because they are "valueable". But what does that even mean? Most people who buy gold don't touch it.; they don't look at it; they don't eat it; they certainly don't make and drink gold smoothies; and they don't plant it to a make gold tree that rains gold in the summer. So what "value" does gold have? gold is means to an end for people who collect, hoard, or invest in it. Feel free to use whatever term you deem appropriate. When people hold gold they are only holding it so that they can sell it later at a higher price than what they bought it at. They know gold has no use. They are simply hoping or know or whatever that in the future they will get more for their gold than what they put in. Again, a means to an end. 

  But in the model so far there is no one else. The one Human "owns" everything and can do whatever they want. There is no need to invest in or hoard gold. No reason for silver or any other metal. Assets like real estate and equity certainly don't exist. Which raises the question then "What is Value?". Ugh, a rather TOUGH question.

  Based on the above reasoning it's rather hard to define Value here, but it's not impossible. You can always declare a way to Value something or some action. In this way you will be creating a value function. In the real world, and we will talk about this a lot later, markets are primarily used as _thee_ value function.
  
  We can say that possible S&D Connections have a Value to them. What would that Value be? Well the Value of a possible S&D Connection would be its ability to facilitate another S&D Connection in the future. This would be the Value Function we are currently using. For instance if there was an S&D Connection about the one Human planting an apple tree we could say that this Connection is rather valuable. Why? Because this allows the one Human in the future to eat apples. I.E. the S&D Connection (of planting the tree) leads to more S&D Connections being possible in the future (eating apples). 

  Decent definition but there are some obvious flaws. Every S&D Connection allows for more S&D Connections in the future. For instance if you made a hole in the sand while at the beach there is an obvious new possible S&D Connection of just filling in the hole. If you kicked a rock there is a new possible S&D Connection of kicking it back to it's original spot. The majority of S&D Connections will lead to new possible S&D Connections that are rather dumb. For these "dumb" S&D Connections we can Value them by how much OUS or SUS they offer the one Human. I'm going to use both OUS and SUS just because we can. The model is not physical and meant to be used as a way of understanding the real world. Because of this we can take into as much information as we want into the Value Function. 

  Another obvious flaw is how far into the future are the new S&D Connections possible? Does it take 20 years for the new S&D Connection to come into fruition? When kicking the rock the new S&D Connection was instant. 

  Both of these flaws would have to be taken into account. Fow now, the Value of each S&D Connection would be the ability to facilitate more S&D Connections in the future with time, OUS, and SUS taken into account.

  In sum, Value is whatever you define it as. Your Value definition is your value function. Here, because there is only one Human, it is rather easy to create a sorta abstract Value function. To mathematically define this function would be whole other problem. Let's just keep it abstract.

## Let's Add A Second Human
  As we saw with one Human there were two aspects to look at. We saw Opportunity Cost and Subjectivity. We also saw a brief glimpse into Value. These concepts were not hard to grasp or even work with. They were easy to work with only because there was only one Human. When we add a second, third, fourth, Nth Human it becomes a bit more complicated. How does Subectivity and Opportunity Cost work when two Humans are Demanding the same Supply? How does ownership work? Does the first Human own everything? Is the second Human then a slave? How do possible S&DC get prioritized? 

  Well to start let's seperate the two Humans simply to make the model easier. In this way they will never Demand the same Supply. Let's also name them to make it easier to work with. The first Human will be named "Adam" and the second "Eve".

  Opportunity Cost and Subjectivity work the same. Both Humans will choose to make S&DC that maximize Internal Utility based on what they view (subjectively) as Utility maximizing. Each Human can "own" whatever is around them and because they are completely seperated there will be no conflicts. 

  Both Humans would live hapy prosperous lives. Their section of the world is their oyseter.

  Rather boring; let's throw them together. 

  Say they did live in the same part of the world and they did interact together. How would it look?

  Well this is a rather tough question. In academics there is behavioral economics to try and explain this, but because I want the model to be completely abstract I will be making one assumption to explain how the Humans will behave. The assumption is that these Humans do no sin. I will call this part of the model pre-sin. Later, when we fully understand the economics of pre-sin, we will move to post-sin. Post-sin is much more complicated. Post-sin is also, quite obviously, where the real world is and where insight can be gleaned. But to understand post-sin we need to understand pre-sin. 

  In pre-sin there is only one assumption. That given any choice the Human will make the Utility Maximizing decision for the biggest group of Humans. What do I mean by this? Humans will always prioritize each other over themselves in this way. In this way there will never be hoarding, no one will be to lazy to work, etc. 

  ### Example 1:
    We have two possible Connections where Adam decides which Connection is to be facilitated. Only one Connection can take place.
    Here the Subjecting force is Adam. The first 'S' in SUS here is Adam. The second 'S' in SUS for this example is for Adam, Eve, and both in that order.

    Possible Connection A
      - OUS = 20 & SUS = 30 for Adam
      - OUS = 15 & SUS = 10 for Eve
    Possible Connection B
      - OUS = 30 & SUS = 25 for both Adam and Eve

    To briefly talk about SUS and OUS for the example: here we know that Adam views Connection A as offering 30 Utility for Adam and 10 Utility for Eve. We also know that the objective change in internal Utility for Adam and Eve will be 20 and 15 respectively. Adam's estimations are decent. He in correct in his estimation that he will enjoy Connection A more than Eve and that Connection B offers better Utility overall.

    Here Adam will choose to facilitate Connection B simply because in B there is greater SUS for everyone. 25 + 25 > 30 + 10. Adam will have facilitated the Connection that creates the most OUS for everyone. While this is the goal for all Humans pre-sin it is not always the case. In the example provided if Connection B had offered 10 SUS for both Adam and Eve then Adam would have chosen to facilitate Connection A. This would not have been the OUS optimizing decision, however, Humans are generally pretty good at making rational choices so Adam and Eve would live rather happy lives together simply because they are both choosing to make Connections that optimize OUS for everyone. Even if they aren't perfectly optimal they are still very happy in both the short and long run. 

  This was an example of pre-sin decision making for one Human between two connections. Let's switch it around and have two Humans with one possible Connection. This will be done by having one Supply that both Adam and Eve Demand. Only one Demand can Connection with the Supply, so only one Human can have a successful Demand for the Supply. In the real world this might be one crab to eat, one chair to sit in, etc.

  ### Example 2:
    We have one Supply with Demands coming from both Adam and Eve. Adam and Eve both have their OUS and SUS in regards to both S&D Connections. 

    Possible Connection A (Adam's Demand Connects with the single Supply)
      - Objective:
        - OUS = 30 for Adam
        - OUS = -3 for Eve
      - Adam's perspective:
        - SUS = 40 for Adam
        - SUS = -1 for Eve
      - Eve's perspective:
        - SUS = 10 for Adam
        - SUS = -5 for Eve

    Possible Connection B (Eve's Demand Connects with the single Supply)
      - Objective:
        - OUS = -1 for Adam
        - OUS = 20 for Eve
      - Adam's perspective:
        - SUS = 0 for Adam
        - SUS = 10 for Eve
      - Eve's perspective:
        - SUS = 1 for Adam
        - SUS = 30 for Eve

    Here there is a conflict. Only one Human's Demand can Connect with the single Supply. Adam and Eve will have to decide between each other who's Demand gets to Connect. Objectively Adam's Connection creates more Utility. Will they decide to facilitate Adam's Connection? 

    Both Humans want to maximize OUS but they believe different Connections maximize OUS. Eve believes Eve's Connections maximizes overall OUS and Adam believes Adam's Connection maximizes OUS. 

    Now in the real world this would talk multiple moments to decide; sometimes minutes, hours, days, even months. But there will be a decision and someone will connect with the single supply. How is this done in a pre-sin world? Adam doesn't know Eve's perspective and Eve doesn't know Adam's perspective. How are they going to decide who gets to Connect?

    They communicate with each other! Adam expresses his opinion on the matter and Eve does the same. Based on the communication each Human will have a better understanding of SUS. Let's speed forward some time and say 5 moments have passed. Now they know each other's perspective better and both have a better understanding of the overall situation.

    Possible Connection A (Adam's Demand Connects with the single Supply)
      - Objective:
        - OUS = 30 for Adam
        - OUS = -3 for Eve
      - Adam's perspective:
        - SUS = 35 for Adam
        - SUS = -2 for Eve
      - Eve's perspective:
        - SUS = 25 for Adam
        - SUS = -3 for Eve

    Possible Connection B (Eve's Demand Connects with the single Supply)
      - Objective:
        - OUS = -1 for Adam
        - OUS = 20 for Eve
      - Adam's perspective:
        - SUS = 0 for Adam
        - SUS = 18 for Eve
      - Eve's perspective:
        - SUS = -2 for Adam
        - SUS = 21 for Eve

    Because of the communication that took place between the two there is now a better understanding of the situation. Adam and Eve both have better subjective estimations of Utility. Of course there is still a problem. Who gets to Connect? Adam and Eve both have their own estimations of Utility but they both know that the true Utility is unknown by both. They will have to come up with a way of deciding.

    Now, with a better understanding, they are both on the same page. Adam's Connections maximizes OUS for everyone and so Adam will Connect. Eve loses some Utility and Adam gains, but the overall Utility change is higher in Connection A than B.

    Of course when Adam's Demand Connects then Eve's will die. There will be no Supply for Eve's Demand to Connect with. 

  ### Take A Step Back
  
  As we can see even in a pre-sin world Demand filters Demand for what Demand Connects with Supply. In the above example there was two Demands and one Supply. Demand decided between itself which Demand should Connect. This was the filtering of Demand!

  Demand filtering Demand is the best way to maximize OUS in S&D Connections. However, Demand filtering Demand will largely only take place in a pre-sin world. 

  Pre-sin, 100% of S&D Connection conflicts, like the one above, will be resolved with Demand filtering Demand. Excluding human error, this leads to maximum overall OUS for all S&D Connections. 
  
  Post-sin, Supply will filter Demand. This will lead to maximum OUS for a sinlge Human at expense of the maximum overall OUS for each S&D Connection. That isn't post-sin a overall OUS maximizing Connection can't take place it just isn't the norm. But for now we do not have to think or worry about post-sin.

## Let's give an overview of the model so far.









### Value Functions in a pre-sin world
Let's ask a _very simple_ question given a Thing. What is the Value of this Thing?
    Let's view the Thing as having Matter and assume there is Humans from Humans or Humans from CoH.
    The question is now "Well what the Value of this Matter given there could possibly be Humans from the origins described?"
    
    Right off the bat we run into a problem. What does Value even mean? Does Value equate to how many Humanss couldn't be connected with Matter? I.E. only Things in a shortage have Value? Maybe Value means how many Humanss for the Matter could make connections? Does the oxygen on Earth have more Value than all the Doornobs simply because all the oxygen on Earth satisfies more Humans than all the doornobs do? Essentially there are an infinite number of ways Value could be described which means this is getting out of hand fast. 
    
    For now let's take a step back. Let's just assume that Value is some abstract equation about Matter and Humans of a Thing. Let's call this function V(T). Value of a Thing. And we can say V(T) is what ever we want. If we want to define Value of a Thing as how much Humans couldn't be connected with Matter (this would be shortages) than we can. We could also define Value as how many Humanss could make connections. Or even how many Humanss did make a connection. Again, lots of ways to define Value.

    Easy enough definition for Value. That means we are done right? No. What moment in Time are we talking about? On the Earth before Humans existed there was no Humans. Again, only Humans Humans. If a fox eats a rabbit that is Things changing over time. That means most Value Functions are going to fail. Value is only in relation to Humans. Matter (Things) itself have no Value.

    For now because we are pre-sin we can easily define Value as a Value Function. I'm going to now define Value as the maximum Utility that can be gained from Humans (Humans). If Humanity have two or more possible interactions with a specific Thing than we can say that the Value of this Thing would be the Value of Utility Maximizing interaction. 

    For example.
    1. Interaction to gain 15 Utility for Human A.
    2. Interaction to gain 20 Utility for Human B.

    Because Human B's interaction gained more Utility, 20 Utility is now the Value of the Thing in that given Time.

    I think this definition would be compatible with the knowledge of Value through all of Time only because this is pre-sin. I think post-sin there is breakdown bc of a want to hoard.

    All this will thrown out the window post-sin. Sing and knowledge of Value over all Time are not compatable.

### HELLO

When you ask the question "What is the Value of a Thing?" We have to know the all information from all of time. And if in the moment any information is used to gain personal leverage (money) than the whole system collapses. Only when everyThing was in the CC did Value have a way to acceptably defined. If the Value of a Thing is known in Time t then the Thing could be hoarded (PP) changing the Value of a Thing. Did hoarding add Value for the Thing?




### SCHIZO

You NEED to wake up early. The devil is gonna wake you up and say "Quick live forever, God will let you die". Those who choose to live forever will surely die. God doesn't care that you are going to die. He was going to give you eternal life anyways. He cares about whether you abandon sin or not. The compounding force with sin leads to death at infinity. Either you go live forever without sin in Heaven or you live forever with sin in Hell.
