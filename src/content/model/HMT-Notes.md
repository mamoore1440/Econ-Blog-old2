# STICKY NOTES
### Schizo One Liners:
* God is giving you one chance at cleansing your infinite state. Do you feel the chance slipping between your fingers as every momeny passes?
  * Don't ask for forgiveness for the sake of others. Don't ask for forgiveness for the sake of family. Don't ask for forgiveness for the sake of society or humanity. 
    Don't ask for forgiveness for the sake of even God of even Jesus. Be selfish! Ask for forgiveness for the sake of yourself! It's not like you won't be forgive for being selfish. If being selfish saves you and has a possibility of saving others then I'm sure God and Jesus would approve.
* Death is a gift from God. Living forever would be hell.
* The angels are like god's rumbas and alexas. The are meant to do tasks but are also given a spirit.
* If we did not sin eternal life would be a utopia. But we do sin so eternal life is a living hell.

* We obviously have both the knowledge to understand the model and the technology to try usurption of basic principles. But in knowing the knowledge we would also know it's not possible. That the perpetual motion machine in both economic and finance were doomed to fail.

* With sin everytime you pull the veil back there is another veil. It never ends.
: God's doesn't even have a veil to pull back: some die just looking at him. 

* My spirit is not my own; God owns it. Only God is good => if I own my spirit than the owner of my spirit is not good &&& if God owns my spirit then the owner of my spirit is good. 


* God wasn't able to split reality into good and evil before sin. He didn't even want to. 
  * Lucifer created Sin and thus allowed for the split to take place.
  * God is good and thus the split is good.
  * Humans are the on the lowest rung of the plato forms pyramid. Only in the thrird dimension could sin actually take place.

* You can see the Devil appointing the next horn based on the way the occult move. 
  * Why did Trump and The Israeli Prime Minister go to the same private college?
  * Why did Trump have a failed Insurrection just like Hitler?
    * Learn more about Napolean. Did he also have this?

* Federalism vs Confederalism (wealth) : redistribution vs entrenchment (wealth) are the same. Who should decide where the line is? Only God can do that
  * God is Good => The Good line will be drawn.
  * Creating an A.I. to draw the line is a REALLY REALLY REALLY good idea. It just doesn't work.
    * I really bet you could get 10T years of dopamine easy. For those that think they could get 10TTT years. I really do believe you; I bet you could. But the problem is it doesn't work at infinity.

### Sociolical One Lines:
* Testing Micro catches all, but discourages and even filters Humans who think in the Macro. Life in school-which tests and rewards micro views-force you to view in the Micro level. Macro is more important however as life is done in macro. Are you asked to write paragraphs on why you bought certain food? Did you have to write down and use equations about sin, cos, and tan? Maybe the quadratic formula? Did you pull out definitions of each of the logic fallacies? Did you recite the Greek Letters in order? Tell of all the associations they have with physics and math? Obviously not! You simply bought the food which is living life on the macro level.
  * Macro doesn't matter more or less than Mirco. But it does have to be put first.

* Humanity inheirantly has a flaw at infinity. When we divide truth and emotion up subjectively we exclude people based on the difference between an individual's viewpoint and a the viewpoint of Humanities (or Societies). 
  * This causes cohesion to drop to 0 at infinity.
  * This is what causes heartbreaks, emotional breakdowns, etc.

* Moral relativism is Humans drawing the line. But Humans suck at drawing the line only God can do that.
  * You draw a line everywhere; even with yourself. Eventually a infinity you'll to die in relation to yourself.

* Cohesion with the self could theoretically stay alive forever, but cohesion with society will forsure collapse to 0 at infinity.

* A populist leader is one that creates the hard line. When economic and financial collapse does happen it removes the percieved line from both an individual and societies reality. But a hard line is needed; some Demands when connect only hurt everyone. These Demands must be filtered and thus the hard line has to be created. Society wants a hard line and a populist leader promises one.


### WW3 One Liners:
* Russia and China won't let you have a democratic republic anymore. They want you to choose a democracy or a republic. Unfortunetly both of these infinitely worse than the 
  combination. But still, all three fail at infinity.
  * Liberalism is inheriently against hard line rules. Hard line rules are necessary for cohesion to last long term. But Conservatives are for hard line rules that are just bad. This 
    is why the two party system doesn't work. It's easy to cut in half through the middle.
* The filter set up by the fake post WW-2 top-secret governments are amazing at catching information. I really bet that there is an at minimum 1/10th of science made secret to us.
* They are trying to create a perpetual motion machine with the economy. What they are actually building is a nuke.

### Econ One Liners:
* Pre-Sin there are two time frames to view economics. Short-term which is intra moment; and long-term which is at infinity. No other time frame inbetween matters.
* GDP is how much Supply was exchanged in a year in terms of ASV.

* We've been wasting production since the 80's. There was no point in keep the work week at 40hrs. It should have been dropping steadily since.
* We've been in a sort of generational recession since the 80's. Every generation has been poorer than the last. It just looks like we are better off wealth wise because the government is lying about inflation. This is because of the 40hr work week is kept even though it makes no sense anymore. But you have to keep people in the wage cage because otherwise they make bad decisions or even worse they make babies. 

* Prioritization of the whole immedietally allows for lots of prioritizing the self. Switch the order and it all falls apart. Prioritizing the self immedietally causes more prioritization to be spent on the whole. You'll have more liesure and less work in heaven.

### Chain Of Logic
This will be the last facist uprising. The only reason you have a fascist uprising is due to the 100-year cycles destroying a society. The 100-year cycle is only possible due to a fundamental misunderstanding in economics. The misunderstanding, or more accurately purposely hidden knowldege, allows for levers to be manipulated that are deemed to be invisable by leading institutions (fed, fed, academics, finance). This allows to attempted usurption of fundamental economic principles in an attempt to never have the 100-year bust.
Facist uprisings are also a great opportunity for Lucifer to push major changes. Because of this fact and this being the last facist uprising Lucifer will have to act during this cycle. We will be forced to enter revelations by Lucifer: simply because Lucifer pulls the most Humans down during the 100-year crash.


### Need To Talk:
* Another benefit to the model's abstractness is that you can view real world events through the model and gain insight. Academics lovs criticing media through different lenses. Little Woman through a Marxist lens; Economics through a Keynsian lens, Austrian, or Chicagoian lens. This is another lens you can view reality through.


### Chess Games
* Each level of the chess games
  * Nations against each other (WW3), White Vs. Black hat (The devil's internal game), The true theological game (Lucifer vs. God)
  * Who plays each level?
  * What does winning and losing look like?
  * Why does this level exist?

* True Theological Game
  * The game between the Devil and God is about what in the third dimension is good and what is evil. If everyone sins then any spirit in the thrid dimension is 
    inheriently evil and thus sins. Jesus having lived a life without sin proves that wrong.
  * When Jesus died he was the first (and only) to be able to split Good and Evil. (Theres like COMS heirarchy here I bet).
  * God could split good and evil whenever he wanted immediatelly after Jesus died. 
  * But God keeps the game running simply because he wants to save the most people. He's holding the checkmate simply to help the elect.


### Generational Conforming.
When Gen X raged against the machine they actually conformed. The truly capitalist amoung them realized what capitalism actually was: it's all about being _greedy_. Remember Reagan with "_Greed Is Good_"? When you sat down and accepted a job instead of being _greedy_ you conformed. What's even worse is that wealth was stolen from you!

The Millenials proudly fell face first into the pit. Accepting a job is conforming. You were not _greedy_. 

And Gen Z lost all focus when they were bombarded with psy ops. Lost in extreme radicalization they are all addicted to the internet and don't know up from down. There are more in Gen Z however that see the truth that the Millenials and Gen X are blind to.

Boomers were _greedy_. They knew what game they were playing and the earth still had resources at large.


### Have To Explain The Model at Times.
It's a good idea to explain the model very abstractly at the start but to be real world with it at the end. It should be like reading a brief history book. When the model needs to be brought in then do it. When explaining these Ideas you will have explain why they happened with the model.
* "Lowering The Rate"
  * Government is saying "Don't worry the future is good", and _you believed them_.
  * This allows more debt which brings more demand forward which which causes more boom.
  * The government doesn't want the true ending to happen. Instead we, as a society through the government, make a bet with our future and say "We'll some spend some Value now but 
    invest it properly. Then when we get to the future we'll have even more". It doesn't really ever work. I'm not sure it even could as Humans are really bad and investing. But to be fair the true game was hidden from them. Humanity doesn't know that the CD-ID spectrum exists for demand.
  * When The Rate is high like in the 70s-80s it says Demand can only be spent if it yields 21% on SV every year. THIS IS INSANE!!!! 21% percent is unheard of. This would occur       
    during 2000+ years ago. And was because of default risk not interest rate risk! America was the only one able to do it because they where the only supply post-ww2. This gave America the ability to Lower The Rate for last 40 years!

* Why the 7-year 100-year cycles happens
  * The 7-year happens because the game of capitalism is to be _greedy_. Eventually this blows up beacuse the _greediness_ turns into scams. Scams arn't even SV profitable. On top of this most debt only creates SV NOT V. This eventually goes bust.
  * The 100-year cycle happens becuse society makes the bet with themselves about the future. Lowering The Rate let's us spend Value now. This only lasts so long. Eventually the bill comes due all deals we made with ourselves default. 

* QE
* Microbooms

### Naming The 100-Year Crash
No one even talks the 100-year cycle. The 7-year cycle is barely talked about and very much not understood. So I've never even seen this idea discused before. Ray Dalio is only person I've seen name it. It unreal to the world that 2008 should have been a of 1929 but wasn't. They don't understand what actually happened. People have never even seen the idea of a micro-boom before. To say that economy is on life support by the government in order to keep the economy alive is unreal. And to say the last 15 years were fake is going to be even harder to take in. But this envelouping cycle can only delayed never avoided. In this way the 100-year Crash has only happened twice! Napolean and Hitler


### I'm an extreme outlier
To see this issue I had to be Gen Z (economic generation issue, and ability to parse information like no tomorrow issue), have ADHD, have aspergers, be "highly intelligent", AND constantly doubt myself.

You have to be willing to aceept that I might know more than you. Because when I talk about academics how it fails to teach certain things. You have to reject that appeal to authority that plagues everyones mind.

I'm only in the position to connect MAJOR dots. I can't give extremely in-depth information on all the minor details. Think of me as a forst ranger who presents a carcass. I can give you the skeleton, some of the flesh, and maybe a story. But the majority I can't find or understand easily: the hidden information is out of my scope of expertise. Nevertheless we can learn from carcsss and glimpse into the future.

### Debt And Cycles
Debt existing and Humans being imperfect => 7-year debt cycle exists
7-year debt cycle and central banks existing => 100-year debt cycle exists

### Utility Needs To Be Temporal
Internal Utility needs to be temporal and so does Utility gained from S&D Connections. Internal Utility would have a "resting" level which would be just risidual happiness or sadness. But Utility gained from an S&D Connections would actually be a function. If you set off a nuke it would be rather fun to watch. But the nulear fallout would suck quite a bit.


### Value Functions in a pre-sin world
Let's ask a _very simple_ question given a Thing. What is the Value of this Thing?
  Let's view the Thing as having Matter and assume there is Humans from Humans or Humans from CoH.
  The question is now "Well what the Value of this Matter given there could possibly be Humans from the origins described?"
  
  Right off the bat we run into a problem. What does Value even mean? Does Value equate to how many Humanss couldn't be connected with Matter? I.E. only Things in a shortage have Value? Maybe Value means how many Humanss for the Matter could make connections? Does the oxygen on Earth have more Value than all the Doornobs simply because all the oxygen on Earth satisfies more Humans than all the doornobs do? Essentially there are an infinite number of ways Value could be described which means this is getting out of hand fast. 
  
  For now let's take a step back. Let's just assume that Value is some abstract equation about Matter and Humans of a Thing. Let's call this function V(T). Value of a Thing. And we can say V(T) is what ever we want. If we want to define Value of a Thing as how much Humans couldn't be connected with Matter (this would be shortages) than we can. We could also define Value as how many Humanss could make connections. Or even how many Humanss did make a connection. Again, lots of ways to define Value.

  Easy enough definition for Value. That means we are done right? No. What moment in Time are we talking about? On the Earth before Humans existed there was no Humans. Again, only Humans Humans. If a fox eats a rabbit that is Things changing over time. That means most Value Functions are going to fail. Value is only in relation to Humans. Matter (Things) itself have no Value.

  For now because we are pre-sin we can easily define Value as a Value Function. I'm going to now define Value as the maximum Utility that can be gained from Humans (Humans). If Humanity have two or more possible interactions with a specific Thing than we can say that the Value of this Thing would be the Value of Utility Maximizing interaction. 

  For example.
  1. Interaction to gain 15 Utility for Human A.
  2. Interaction to gain 20 Utility for Human B.

  Because Human B's interaction gained more Utility, 20 Utility is now the Value of the Thing in that given Time.

  I think this definition would be compatible with the knowledge of Value through all of Time only because this is pre-sin. I think post-sin there is breakdown bc of a want to hoard.

  All this will thrown out the window post-sin. Sin and knowledge of Value over all Time are not compatable.

### Value
When you ask the question "What is the Value of a Thing?" We have to know the all information from all of time. And if in the moment any information is used to gain personal leverage (money) than the whole system collapses. Only when everyThing was in the CC did Value have a way to acceptably defined. If the Value of a Thing is known in Time t then the Thing could be hoarded (PP) changing the Value of a Thing. Did hoarding add Value to the Thing?

### SCHIZO
You NEED to wake up early. The devil is gonna wake you up and say "Quick live forever, God will let you die". Those who choose to live forever will surely die. God doesn't care that you are going to die. He was going to give you eternal life anyways. He cares about whether you abandon sin or not. The compounding force with sin leads to death at infinity. Either you go live forever without sin in Heaven or you live forever with sin in Hell.

### FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AR GROUP DELUSIONS
People are looking at an apple and saying it is an orange. This delusion happens on mass and thus it is now acceptable. When an outsider comes in and says "Well, you guys are wrong. This orange is actually an apple." the others will disagree. But who is right? The majority will be right up until the moment when the apple actually has to act like an orange. Only then will the financial system be exposed as an apple. But until that moment the majority will hate the minority for saying the truth because the minority is popping the bubble of the majority. The minority is saying "yall are wrong. And in a big way." which the majority isn't too happy about. This is why contrarians who say we are in a bubble are hated. What an asshole you must be to say the truth like that. The majority is quite happy in the delusion that the apple is an orange. Only until the moment the apple is exposed irreversably to be an apple. Then the world falls apart and must be put back together. 

### BEAR MARKETS
To see we are in a bubble or that a bear market is coming you must be a contrarian. To profit off of a bear market you must be a contrarian to the contrarians. 

BMR steps
1. Bears must get checked
2. Bulls must get checked
3. Bears must get checked again
4. Bulls believe they are unstoppable
5. Bulls lose and the BMR fails. A drop occurs.
