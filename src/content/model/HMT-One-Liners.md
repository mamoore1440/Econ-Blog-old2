## One Liners:
### Devil's Chess Game One Liners:
* We obviously have both the knowledge to understand the model and the technology to try usurption of basic principles. But in knowing the knowledge we would also know it's not possible. That the perpetual motion machine in both economic and finance were doomed to fail.

### Life, Death, And Sin One Liners:
* If we did not sin eternal life would be a utopia. But we do sin so eternal life is a living hell.
* Death is a gift from God. Living forever would be hell.


* God is giving you one chance at cleansing your infinite state. Do you feel the chance slipping between your fingers as every momeny passes?
  * Don't ask for forgiveness for the sake of others. Don't ask for forgiveness for the sake of family. Don't ask for forgiveness for the sake of society or humanity. 
  Don't ask for forgiveness for the sake of even God of even Jesus. Be selfish! Ask for forgiveness for the sake of yourself! It's not like you won't be forgive for being selfish. If being selfish saves you and has a possibility of saving others then I'm sure God and Jesus would approve.


### Reality, God, Jesus One Liners:
* The angels are like god's rumbas and alexas. The are meant to do tasks but are also given a spirit.

###  

### Schizo One Liners:


* God wasn't able to split reality into good and evil before sin. He didn't even want to. 
  * Lucifer created Sin and thus allowed for the split to take place.
  * God is good and thus the split is good.
  * Humans are the on the lowest rung of the plato forms pyramid. Only in the thrird dimension could sin actually take place.

* You can see the Devil appointing the next horn based on the way the occult move. 
  * Why did Trump and The Israeli Prime Minister go to the same private college?
  * Why did Trump have a failed Insurrection just like Hitler?
    * Learn more about Napolean. Did he also have this?

* Federalism vs Confederalism (wealth) : redistribution vs entrenchment (wealth) are the same. Who should decide where the line is? Only God can do that
  * God is Good => The Good line will be drawn.
  * Creating an A.I. to draw the line is a REALLY REALLY REALLY good idea. It just doesn't work.
    * I really bet you could get 10T years of dopamine easy. For those that think they could get 10TTT years. I really do believe you; I bet you could. But the problem is it doesn't work at infinity.

### Sociolical One Lines:
* Testing Micro catches all, but discourages and even filters Humans who think in the Macro. Life in school-which tests and rewards micro views-force you to view in the Micro level. Macro is more important however as life is done in macro. Are you asked to write paragraphs on why you bought certain food? Did you have to write down and use equations about sin, cos, and tan? Maybe the quadratic formula? Did you pull out definitions of each of the logic fallacies? Did you recite the Greek Letters in order? Tell of all the associations they have with physics and math? Obviously not! You simply bought the food which is living life on the macro level.
  * Macro doesn't matter more or less than Mirco. But it does have to be put first.

* Humanity inheirantly has a flaw at infinity. When we divide truth and emotion up subjectively we exclude people based on the difference between an individual's viewpoint and a the viewpoint of Humanities (or Societies). 
  * This causes cohesion to drop to 0 at infinity.
  * This is what causes heartbreaks, emotional breakdowns, etc.

* Moral relativism is Humans drawing the line. But Humans suck at drawing the line only God can do that.
  * You draw a line everywhere; even with yourself. Eventually a infinity you'll to die in relation to yourself.

* Cohesion with the self could theoretically stay alive forever, but cohesion with society will forsure collapse to 0 at infinity.

* A populist leader is one that creates the hard line. When economic and financial collapse does happen it removes the percieved line from both an individual and societies reality. But a hard line is needed; some Demands when connect only hurt everyone. These Demands must be filtered and thus the hard line has to be created. Society wants a hard line and a populist leader promises one.


### WW3 One Liners:
* Russia and China won't let you have a democratic republic anymore. They want you to choose a democracy or a republic. Unfortunetly both of these infinitely worse than the 
  combination. But still, all three fail at infinity.
  * Liberalism is inheriently against hard line rules. Hard line rules are necessary for cohesion to last long term. But Conservatives are for hard line rules that are just bad. This 
    is why the two party system doesn't work. It's easy to cut in half through the middle.
* The filter set up by the fake post WW-2 top-secret governments are amazing at catching information. I really bet that there is an at minimum 1/10th of science made secret to us.
* They are trying to create a perpetual motion machine with the economy. What they are actually building is a nuke.

### Econ One Liners:
* Pre-Sin there are two time frames to view economics. Short-term which is intra moment; and long-term which is at infinity. No other time frame inbetween matters.
* GDP is how much Supply was exchanged in a year in terms of ASV.

* We've been wasting production since the 80's. There was no point in keep the work week at 40hrs. It should have been dropping steadily since.
* We've been in a sort of generational recession since the 80's. Every generation has been poorer than the last. It just looks like we are better off wealth wise because the government is lying about inflation. This is because of the 40hr work week is kept even though it makes no sense anymore. But you have to keep people in the wage cage because otherwise they make bad decisions or even worse they make babies. 

* Prioritization of the whole immedietally allows for lots of prioritizing the self. Switch the order and it all falls apart. Prioritizing the self immedietally causes more prioritization to be spent on the whole. You'll have more liesure and less work in heaven.
